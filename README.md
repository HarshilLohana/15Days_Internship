## Amazon Product Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis conducted by a team on a substantial dataset consisting of over 500,000 unique products sold on Amazon over the past three years.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and initially provided in multiple CSV files categorized by product type. For ease of analysis, we consolidated these files into a single CSV file, which is available in this repository.

### Concepts Covered and Applied in This Project: 
- Web Scrapping
- Power Query Editor
- JIRA for Project Management
- Power BI for Data Visualization
- Python libraries (Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib ,Seaborn)
- Postgres SQL 
- Hypothisis Testing 


#### Web Scrapping:
- We explored and implemented web scraping techniques using Python, employing libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. We also addressed challenges posed by anti-scraping mechanisms used by major e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, which can block personal IP addresses due to excessive request rates.
#### Power Query Editor
- In this project, we leveraged Power Query Editor to perform data transformation and cleansing tasks. Power Query Editor, a feature within Power BI, allowed us to efficiently handle the data preprocessing steps without the need for extensive coding.
- **Data Loading**
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Data Transformation**
- **Data Integration**


#### Python Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Python played a crucial role in our data analysis and visualization processes. We utilized several powerful libraries to manipulate and analyze our data effectively:

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and handling large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Pandas**: Leveraged for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and aggregating datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
